/**
 The basis of most Django requests in DjangoSwift.
 
 This protocol should only be adopted via one of the subtypes:
 * `DjangoGETRequest` and subtypes
 * `DjangoPUTRequest`
 * `DjangoPOSTRequest`
 * `DjangoPATCHRequest`
 * `DjangoDELETERequest`
 
 Each request will, at minimum, contain two things:
 1) A `Response typealias` that points to a class that conforms to `DjangoResponse` or one of its subtypes
 2) An `endpoint`.  This should **not** include the domain, only the path

 See `DjangoRequest` subtypes for more information into each specific type of request
