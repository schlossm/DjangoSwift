/**
 The basis of most REST requests in RESTSwift.
 
 This protocol should only be adopted via one of the subtypes:
 * `RESTGETRequest` and subtypes
 * `RESTPUTRequest`
 * `RESTPOSTRequest`
 * `RESTPATCHRequest`
 * `RESTDELETERequest`
 
 Each request will, at minimum, contain two things:
 1) A `Response typealias` that points to a class that conforms to `RESTResponse` or one of its subtypes
 2) An `endpoint`.  This should **not** include the domain, only the path

 See `RESTRequest` subtypes for more information into each specific type of request
